# üö≤ V√©lib Usage Time Series Analysis between Cit√© Universitaire and Dauphine

This project aims to analyze the V√©lib bike-sharing system in Paris, focusing especially on two stations I use daily: Cit√© Universitaire and Universit√© Paris Dauphine. The goal is to understand historical and real-time bike availability patterns, especially for electric bikes, and build predictive algorithms to recommend the best time for picking up and dropping off bikes.

## üìú Project Overview

I use V√©lib every day for commuting between Cit√© Universitaire and Dauphine. To optimize my commute, I analyze historical and real-time V√©lib data to predict when electric bikes are likely to be available to pick up and when docks will be free to return bikes. This involves collecting time-series snapshots from the system over time.

## üöÄ Approach Summary

### Data Collection
- Automated periodic collection of real-time status from the V√©lib API every 10 minutes.
- Storing snapshots of bike counts, availability, and station metadata with timestamps.

### Data Analysis
- Comparing distributions of mechanical vs electric bikes.
- Visualizing temporal patterns, hourly/daily usage trends, and dock occupancy rates.
- Identifying high-demand regions and temporal usage clusters.

### Feature Engineering
- Extracting time-based features (hour of day, day of week).
- Constructing lagged features for time series forecasting.
- Optionally including weather or event data for richer context.

### Modeling & Prediction
- Comparison of predictive models built with:
  - **Scikit-learn** (classical machine learning such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regression).
  - **PyTorch** (deep learning recurrent networks such as LSTM and GRU).
- This comparison allows exploring the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and forecasting accuracy.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Understand usage dynamics at Cit√© Universitaire and Dauphine stations.
- Predict optimal time windows for picking up electric bikes.
- Predict optimal times for returning bikes to avoid full docks.
- Provide actionable and personalized recommendations to improve daily commutes.

## üîß Technology Stack

- **Python** with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.
- **Requests** for API data fetching.
- **Scikit-learn** for classical machine learning models.
- **PyTorch** for deep learning sequence models.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory analysis and documentation.

## üìà Impact

- Enhanced personal commute planning with data-driven insights.
- Demonstration of time series forecasting approaches for urban mobility.
- Potential framework applicable to other bike-sharing or shared micro-mobility systems.
